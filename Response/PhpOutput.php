	 * Send a cookie to the browser.
	 * @param string $name     The name of the cookie.
	 * @param string $value    The value of the cookie.
	 * @param int    $expire   The time the cookie expires. This is a Unix
	 *                         timestamp so is in number of seconds since the
	 *                         epoch. In other words, you'll most likely set
	 *                         this with the time() function plus the number of
	 *                         seconds before you want it to expire. Or you
	 *                         might use mktime(). time()+60*60*24*30 will set
	 *                         the cookie to expire in 30 days. If set to 0, or
	 *                         omitted, the cookie will expire at the end of the
	 *                         session (when the browser closes).
	 * @param string $path     The path on the server in which the cookie will
	 *                         be available on. If set to '/', the cookie will
	 *                         be available within the entire domain. If set to
	 *                         '/foo/', the cookie will only be available within
	 *                         the /foo/ directory and all sub-directories such
	 *                         as /foo/bar/ of domain. The default value is the
	 *                         current directory that the cookie is being set
	 *                         in.
	 * @param string $domain   The domain that the cookie is available to. To
	 *                         make the cookie available on all subdomains of
	 *                         example.com (including example.com itself) then
	 *                         you'd set it to '.example.com'. Although some
	 *                         browsers will accept cookies without the initial
	 *                         ., RFC 2109 requires it to be included. Setting
	 *                         the domain to 'www.example.com' or
	 *                         '.www.example.com' will make the cookie only
	 *                         available in the www subdomain.
	 * @param bool   $secure   Indicates that the cookie should only be
	 *                         transmitted over a secure HTTPS connection from the
	 *                         client. When set to TRUE, the cookie will only be
	 *                         set if a secure connection exists.
	 * @param bool   $httponly When TRUE the cookie will be made accessible only
	 *                         through the HTTP protocol. This means that the
	 *                         cookie won't be accessible by scripting
	 *                         languages, such as JavaScript. It has been
	 *                         suggested that this setting can effectively help
	 *                         to reduce identity theft through XSS attacks
	 *                         (although it is not supported by all browsers),
	 *                         but that claim is often disputed.
